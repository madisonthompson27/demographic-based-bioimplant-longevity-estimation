# demographic-based-bioimplant-longevity-estimation

An open-source software that takes age, race, gender, height, weight, and bioimplant type as inputs to visually represent predicted changes in bone metrics.
Bone metrics refer to changes in density, mass, and volume of the human femur that are directly correlated with the elastic modulus of the bioimplant used.
